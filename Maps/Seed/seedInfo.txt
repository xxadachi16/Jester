    first draft of random generation with seeds

    seedInput(String s) takes in any characters from the player
    seedFormater(String s) turns it into a usable seed that the player can use using the binary blah blah blah it doesn't really matter as long as no 1 x gives 2 y returns a number probably
    roomRandom(int n) 
    has a static value that ranges from 1-the total number of rooms created, 
    takes the seed and puts it through an abirtrary formula mod(rooms possible) to pick a room then update a number, 
    if the room is incompatible just go again, 
    can and should be used for other things even though that would techinically make all random things bound by the room number,
    returns an integer

    worldCreator(int n) takes value from roomRandom and creates a new tileMap,
    there's a big static map "world" containing on the maps currently loaded
    EX: 
    [ -1, -1, -1,
      -1, -1, -1,
       0, -1, -1, ]
    start at world[world.length-1-r][c] and fill this in with room0 where r = c = 0
    iterate through this filling in each -1 with a random room iterating r for every c
    end at world[0][world[0].length-1] = -2 which is the goal room 
    this will make it so the player always starts at the bottom and works his way to the top corner which takes advantage of the tempo mechanic

    ! ! !
    MAKE SURE EDGE ROOMS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE MIDDLE ROOMS BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE DIFFERENT
    ! ! !

    if you want to have rooms that are fancy shapes it looks the same on the macro level but on the micro level just make sure it completes
    EX: room 2 would actually just be 2 rooms put together with predictable exits

    if you want the exits to not be predictable create the whole map and then remove chunks between each room

    worldGenerator(int[][] w) takes worldCreator and turns it into a map
    the advantage of having worldCreator and worldGenerator seperate even though world isn't static is uhhh so you can put in strings and worlds to get the same result which may come in useful later most likely probably
    maybe do all this on a loop before player is loaded
