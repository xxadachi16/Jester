# Jester
Rouge-lite speedrunning game Jester based on a tempo speed mechanic


	Jester

-General
Fast paced speedrun game funky music Block parry dodge with a time crunch and a momentum system. The more hits you land the more momentum you get. Momentum increases your damage and speed. If you get hit it removes all of it. If your attack gets dodged you lose some. Parry increases it a little or you keep it the same. There probably needs to be some counter measure like sturdiness or smth idk. Also it’s a fighting game with classes. Rouge like game. Main mode is fighting dungeon crawler probably until the final boss against The Jester and the other mode is just pvp I guess.

-Gameplay
The player is a toy trying to fight his way out of the bedroom closet. You pick your toy and battle through the other toys around the bedroom. You’re also on a time limit because the kid is coming home from school soon. Roguelike upgrades as you pick up the weapons of toys you defeat but you can only pick one. 

UI 
Momentum is purple and yellow to match a jester type thing.
Basically when you defeat an enemy you can either upgrade your hp or momentum reservoir, take their weapon, take their armor, or take one of their spells.

-Spell system
The spells are like special batteries for the toy. If your toy has 3 battery slots total, you could equip three weak baby triple a batteries for weaker spells, or 1 big single a battery for a strong spell.

-Classes
Each class is like their own kind of toy and would vary in battery slots, hp, momentum gain and conservation, and maybe weapon and speed. For example, if the player was a toy plane, it would have low battery slots, hp, and conservation because planes are kind of fragile. But the planes momentum gain would be really good and it would also hit very hard and move fast. Compare this to an action figure who is slower and would gain momentum slower than the plane but conserve it way better and have decent stats all around. The long term upgrades would make their niche even better as opposed to buffing all their stats.

-Navigation
Basically it’s just a parallel circuit where it all starts in one place and ends in one place but there’s different branches in the middle. Each area would give a permanent unlock if you explore it enough which would incentivize exploration. They would also give temporary upgrades so you can strategize which areas you want to go to in order to be prepared enough for The Jester. For example, maybe going to the Under the Bed location would give you a temporary upgrade which reduces one of your battery spell’s cost by one. It makes sense because batteries would get lost under the bed. Whereas going up to the trophy shelf would give you a super good “gold” weapon.

-The Jester
He’s gatekeeping the outside world. The lore is that The Jester is the kid’s favorite toy and he doesn’t want to see the kid heartbroken so he tries to prevent your escape. He used to try and escape but then he realized how important he was to the kid. Fighting The Jester by itself could be it’s own gamemode. The Jester should have a moveset similar to the player’s or the player’s previous runs. If you beat The Jester the kid’s cat garfield blocks the way out and the kid comes back home which sends you back to the beginning.
